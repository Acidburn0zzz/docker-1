# Docker
--------
A documentation generator built on the foundations of [Docco](http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/) and [Docco-Husky](https://github.com/mbrevoort/docco-husky).

The support available in Docco and Docco-Husky for larger projects consisting of many hundreds of script files was somewhat lacking, so I decided to create my own.

## Installation
---------------
Well, I may well even get this on npm at some point. Not yet though as it's such a WIP.

Requires [Pygments](http://pygments.org/)
